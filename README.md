# To-Do-List

The app allows you to create custom to-do-lists. A very simple website. Easy to navigate. I will be updating the website with more features.

## Usage
For the mean time, if you want to create a custom to-do-list instead of the default "Today", add the title of the list to the end of your localhost. 

```bash
localhost:<port>/<custom title>
```
Checking the box beside an item automatically deletes it.
